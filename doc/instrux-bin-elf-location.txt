the link 'CURRENT.d' is maintained in two places (two
instances, spelling is the same but do not have to be).

 $ pwd
 /some/path/to/vsc-camelforth-esp32

 $ ls -la | ag CURR
lrwxrwxrwx   1 abcdef abcdef    22 Mar 21 17:28 CURRENT.d -> /tmp/arduino/CURRENT.d

so, locally (in ./vsc-camelforth-esp32) there is a link that simply
points to the other link (found in /tmp/arduino).

The one in /tmp/arduino points to a very long directory name,
under /tmp/arduino/sketches.  This name may change; but in common
use the name won't change even between vscode sessions.

Which is convenient. ;)

Otherwise it'd have to be maintained fairly often - or some
other scheme employed to get to the same goal (convenient
means to point to the compiled binary .bin and .elf files,
in wokwi.toml).

end.
