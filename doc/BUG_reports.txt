  When NEWLINE is used at keyboard (press ENTER) there is one extra
  blank line on the display terminal in vscode wokwi than expected.

  slemit &c. the accept threaded word definition maybe.

  Keyboard heuristics for backspace-based correction way off
  for vscode 'Wokwi Terminal' wrt this program's basic
  functionality.

  Try: print hexadecimal keystrokes to see what the forth interpreter
  is using as input and perhaps adjust the code to accomodate this
  unusual environment.

  Expect: no upstream help; to resolve locally. ;)

  Be sure to: adjust so that it only modifies this environment's use
  of the source code - real targets and text terminals 'do not count'
  in this (possibly ;)

  Alternate: try another text terminal 'somehow' if possible.  Probably
  a no-go (using Wokwi Terminal is mandatory in the wokwi vscode
  extension, is the assumption here).

end.
